## Problem Statement
Numerous RV parks continue to use outdated reservation techniques such as phone calls, manual logs, or limited web portals. Administrative inefficiencies, inadequate resource monitoring, and duplicate bookings are common. Real-time occupancy tracking, permit control, and space allocation remain challenging, leading to delays, confusion, and data inaccuracies for both employees and travelers.

---

## Proposed Solution
A **web-based RV park administration system** will be developed to simplify reservation management for both employees and visitors. Through an intuitive interface, users will be able to reserve campsites, verify availability, and automatically track permits — ensuring efficient operations, accurate data, and improved customer satisfaction.
